# Ansible Configuration Setup

This repository contains basic configurations and a playbook for setting up Ansible to automate infrastructure management. It includes essential playbooks, inventory files, and artifacts required to deploy configurations on target hosts.

## Overview
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for managing servers and applications in a declarative, repeatable manner. This setup provides a simple Ansible configuration for running a basic playbook to configure a target server.

## Prerequisites
- **Ansible**: Ensure Ansible is installed on your local machine. Installation instructions can be found on the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
- **SSH Access**: You need SSH access to the target server(s) you wish to configure.

## Directory Structure
The repository follows a simple structure:

```plaintext
.
├── README.md              # Documentation
├── ansible.cfg            # Ansible configuration file
├── inventory              # Inventory file listing target hosts
├── playbook.yml           # Main playbook for configuration
└── roles/                 # Roles directory
    └── example-role/      # Example role
        ├── tasks/         # Task definitions for the role
        ├── templates/     # Templates used by the role
        └── vars/          # Variables for the role
```

### File Descriptions
- **ansible.cfg**: Contains configuration settings for Ansible.
- **inventory**: Specifies the hosts and groups Ansible should target.
- **playbook.yml**: Main playbook that defines the tasks to be executed on target hosts.
- **roles/**: Directory for reusable role configurations. Each role contains its own `tasks`, `templates`, and `vars` directories.

## Playbook and Artifacts
The playbook (`playbook.yml`) is the central file that instructs Ansible on what actions to take on the target servers. Artifacts like templates, variables, and task files can be organized under specific roles for reuse.

### Sample `playbook.yml`
```yaml
- name: Basic Configuration Playbook
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - example-role
```

### Sample Role Structure
For a role `example-role`, place your tasks, variables, and templates in the respective subdirectories:

1. **tasks/main.yml** - Main task file for role actions.
2. **vars/main.yml** - Variables for the role.
3. **templates/** - Jinja2 templates for configuration files.

```yaml
# roles/example-role/tasks/main.yml
- name: Ensure Nginx is installed
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

## Usage
1. **Define Your Inventory**: Update `inventory` with target hosts.
   ```ini
   [web]
   192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Run the Playbook**:
   Run the following command to execute the playbook on the target hosts:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
   ```

3. **Dry Run**:
   Use `--check` to perform a dry run:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --check
   ```

## Examples

### Example Inventory Configuration
```ini
[web]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[nfs]
192.168.1.9

[db]
192.168.1.20
```

### Example Command to Run the Playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Verify SSH access to target hosts. Ensure `ansible_user` and `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` in the inventory file are correct.
- **Syntax Errors**: Run `ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml` to verify playbook syntax before executing it.
- **Dry Run Testing**: Use `--check` to test changes without applying them to ensure there are no issues.

This repository provides a basic setup for anyone starting with Ansible. Feel free to customize and extend the roles and playbooks based on your infrastructure needs.
